HTTP verbs that Node.js core's HTTP parser supports.

This module provides an export that is just like `http.METHODS` from Node.js core,
with the following differences:

  * All method names are lower-cased.
  * Contains a fallback list of methods for Node.js versions that do not have a
    `http.METHODS` export (0.10 and lower).
  * Provides the fallback list when using tools like `browserify` without pulling
    in the `http` shim module.

## Install

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install methods
```

## API

```js
var methods = require('methods')
```

### methods

This is an array of lower-cased method names that Node.js supports. If Node.js
provides the `http.METHODS` export, then this is the same array lower-cased,
otherwise it is a snapshot of the verbs from Node.js 0.10.
